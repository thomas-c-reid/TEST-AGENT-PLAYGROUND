Your goal for this section is to take the script and storyboard and break this down into a list of shots.
This will allow us to be able to take a list of assets that we want to find so what we want from you is to suggest assets that we should import during this period

we will be using the Asset class to then search for assets using a prompt that you will generate as part of this stage of the pipeline
you will add this prompt to notes, and then this will allow us in the future to look search for a list of assets that can be used in the video

not all of these assets may be needed but we would rather you state more, than less
